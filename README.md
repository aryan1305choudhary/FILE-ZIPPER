# FILE-ZIPPER
Designed a file compression and decompression utility using Huffman coding to optimize data storage. Implemented variable-length encoding to reduce file size while ensuring lossless data preservation. Utilized priority queues to efficiently manage node frequencies when building Huffman tree, practically applying Data Structures.
